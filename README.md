# tax-planning
plan your tax roughly with a couple of questions

A couple of notes:
- Code works in local, not connected and nothing stored in cloud
- When run in terminal or on any IDE (I use PyCharm), it interactively computes tax liability. Very similar to TurboTax
- The difference is that this is very simple, takes a couple minutes, yet doesn't fit to all.
- It only works for people who has W2
- Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) mechanism is not added yet
- Only works for married jointly filing option so far. 

How to run:
- Download the code in ZIP
- Run get_user_input.py
